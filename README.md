This repo contains camera filters/scenes created using Babylon.js

How to use:

In OBS Studio create a new Browser element via Sources(+) -> Browser -> Create New.

Change the URL to the path of the source code i.e:

./CameraTest/index.html in this repo becomes:

https://drigax.github.io/BabylonWebCamFX/CameraTest/index.html

These scenes can also be pathed locally, using the absolute path to the scene index.html on disk.
